Hospital Resource Utilization &amp; Patient Outcomes Dashboard An end-to-end healthcare analytics project built for Hackathon Carnival 2026. This project analyzes hospital admissions, patient outcomes, staffing, and resource utilization using SQL and Power BI to generate actionable insights for hospital operations.
# Hospital Resource Utilization & Patient Outcomes Dashboard

This project was developed as part of Hackathon Carnival 2026 to design an interactive analytics system for hospital operations. The goal is to monitor, analyze, and optimize hospital resources while improving patient outcomes using data-driven insights.

## 🎯 Objective

To build a scalable healthcare analytics dashboard that helps hospital administrators:

- Monitor admissions and discharge trends
- Track resource utilization (ICU, beds, ventilators)
- Analyze patient outcomes and readmission rates
- Evaluate doctor workload and staffing efficiency
- Understand billing patterns and cost distribution
- Identify operational bottlenecks

## 🗂 Dataset Structure

The dataset includes:

- Patients: demographics and insurance details
- Admissions: department, branch, admission/discharge times
- Resources: ICU usage, bed days, shortages
- Staff: doctor shift hours and utilization
- Billing: cost breakdown and insurance claims
- Outcomes: recovery status and readmission

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) – data modeling & analytics
- Power BI – interactive dashboard visualization
- Excel – dataset preprocessing
- GitHub – project documentation

## 📊 Key KPIs

- Average Length of Stay (ALOS)
- Bed occupancy trends
- Readmission rate (30-day)
- Department workload comparison
- Resource shortage alerts
- Revenue analysis
- Doctor utilization rate
- Patient outcome classification

## 🔍 Insights Generated

- Peak admission hours for staffing optimization
- High-cost departments and procedures
- Resource bottleneck identification
- Insurance claim trends
- Outcome-based performance tracking

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Predictive analytics for resource shortages
- Automated reporting pipeline
- Real-time hospital monitoring dashboard
- AI-based patient risk scoring
